We further validated the generalizability of the model against a set of 1,278 sgRNAs targeting 414 genes, using data from an earlier screen for viability effects in A375 cells, a human melanoma line9. We examined functional categories previously established to be most highly enriched for essential genes in all cell types (e.g., proteasome, ribosome) and analyzed the subset of genes that, in this viability screen, had multiple targeting sgRNAs that were depleted over time9,12,13. We then compared the predicted-efficacy scores for the sgRNAs targeting these 414 genes to their observed depletion in the screen. Similar to our observations for the FACS protein knockout assay, we saw that the highest quintile of predicted scores comprised the greatest proportion of high-activity sgRNAs, whereas the lowest-score quintile had the most low-activity sgRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10). This prediction of activity for 1,278 sgRNAs targeting 414 genes, together with the high consistency observed in the base preferences across all sgRNAs for 9 genes, show that the model presented here generalizes widely to predict highly active sgRNAs.

Negative selection. Cells with working machinery lose function of a necessary gene. Log2 change = amount at start - amount at end
