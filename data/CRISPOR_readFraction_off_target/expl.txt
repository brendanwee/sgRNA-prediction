Collection of all off-targets and their frequencies from all off-target studies. The fields of the table are: name of the guide (guide), its sequence (guideSeq), the sequence of the off-target (otSeq), the specificity score of the guide determined with up to four mismatches (guideSpecScore4MM), the GC content of the guide (guideGcCont), the fraction of reads or lentiviral integration sites for this off-target (readFraction), the number of mismatches of the off-target to the guide (mismatches), the Hsu et al. off-target score (outscore), a string indicating with stars where the mismatches are located over the length of the guide sequence (otLogo), the minimal number of mismatches if a deletion is allowed in the guide sequence (bulgeRnaMmCount), the guide sequence with this deletion marked in parentheses (bulgeRnaGuideSeq), the minimal number of mismatches if a deletion is allowed in the off-target sequence (bulgeDnaMmCount), and the off-target sequence with the deletion marked (bulgeDnaOtSeq). Bulge information is shown only if the number of mismatches obtained by the deletion is at least three less than the number of mismatches without the deletion; otherwise the fields are set to “−1”.

We will use the readFraction column as the label
